## 📘 Project Background

The goal of this project is to design and implement a relational database system with real-world features such as data browsing, reporting, batch updates, and full integrity control through triggers and stored logic.

---

## 📋 Requirements

### Functional:
- Generate reports for key business areas
- Enable mass updates and batch operations
- Provide data browsing functionality

### Non-functional:
- Compatible with both MS SQL Server and Oracle
- Maintain referential integrity through triggers
- Optimize for performance using indexes

---

## 🧠 Conceptual Model (Chen)

- ER diagram presenting main entities and relationships.

---

## 🗃️ Logical and Physical Design

- List of entities and attributes
- Table structure with data types
- Logical and physical relationships

---

## 📜 SQL Scripts

Includes creation of tables, indexes, views, stored procedures, functions, triggers, and data population for both MS SQL Server and Oracle environments.

---

## 👁️ Views

Reusable queries for reporting and simplified data access.

---

## 🔄 Stored Procedures & Functions

Used for generating reports, fetching specific data views, and handling business logic.

---

## 🧬 Triggers and Data Modifications

Automatic data validation and consistency enforcement.

---

## 📊 Database Schema

Visual schema of all tables and relations.

---

## ✅ Conclusions

This project demonstrates an end-to-end implementation of a fully-featured database system using both SQL Server and Oracle, complete with stored logic and multi-layered data access methods.
